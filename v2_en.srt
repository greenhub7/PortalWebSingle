1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
How are you, man?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Look, the form is great, it's very hard.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We just have some quotes to correct.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here, if you look, for example, at the Azure Update in record 11,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I have almost all the data loaded.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Notice that here we have values, here we have values,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We have values ​​here, there.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Here, this is not being saved for me.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I would have to validate if it is something specific that has been left,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but, well, that's not up to you.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If you correct it, then you might get something extra,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
it would be appreciated.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But no, don't worry about that part.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
However, look, there is data here.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This one is not carrying me, nor is it saving me,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But anyway, that has nothing to do with you.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What else?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Here, look, all this is full, all this is full.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Here there is data.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There is also information here.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
These are not being saved either.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I have to validate that.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
These are not being saved either, but still,

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's something I have to validate.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
These are also not being saved.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, since they are not saved, obviously they are not loaded either.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
or they are not loaded and are being saved.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's something I figure out, don't worry about it.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But the point is, and here too, this is failing me.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And this one.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Everything that is not full right now is because it is failing me.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
However, if all this data is full

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not loading everything here.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Here, for example, before and before familiar.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If I go to relatives.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Here is data.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Here's TB, yeah.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
TB, I should check yes here.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Diabetes.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Diabetes here, it's yes, you should check yes here.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And if I check type 1 or type 2, it should bring it here.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Here I already have type 1 in family members.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
In type 1 relatives.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, in type 1 relatives you really have nowhere to match.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But in type 1 personals, for example, it should fall here.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Which would be straight into yes, really.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If I check yes, I should check here.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Per se.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And it's not falling.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes frame type 2.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That is, checking yes would be the same as type 2.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They are little details that I took care of.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But if I mark type 2.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, it should fall here.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And with marking yes, personal.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm here on personals.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
By checking yes, in diabetes, you can fall here.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This one must fall.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, genital surgery or I don't know what.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Genitourinary surgery.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Look here.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's marked like this and it's not here.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Here in gestures, you marked almost all of them, which is great.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But this opiate pregnancy has data.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Stopic pregnancy.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Look here.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It has data.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And it's not here.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Births.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It says 0.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But here you give birth.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh well, it's marked 0.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Alright.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I thought I marked 1.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, end of previous pregnancy.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
End of previous pregnancy.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Notice that it has data.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And he didn't put it here.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So, I didn't use it.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In fact, the opposite is being said here.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Look.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Here he set a barrier, gave a norm, I don't know what, etcetera, etcetera.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
While here I really, well, really there I don't know where that data comes from.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because look, barrier.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Previous failure method, conception.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So, above method failure.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Barrier is the one who is marked.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Look.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I update.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It is the one that is marked.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, here he put a barrier, gave me, etc.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Planned pregnancy.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Planned pregnancy.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It is marked yes.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And here it is marked no.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So, here on vaccines.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In vaccines.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Where is?

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Vaccine, vaccine, vaccines.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Vaccines.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So, no tetanus vaccine, right?

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So, tetanus is no.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Perfect.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They are all no.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
They are all no.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They are all no.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But here, TDAP is yes, prior to pregnancy.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That is, TDAP should check here.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not marking.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Influence too.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Influence is also marked here.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
However, here it is marked where it is not.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Dates are not loading.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
All these dates are not loading.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This value one is not being checked here.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And these values ​​one, two, one, two, two, one

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They are not marking here.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And either way it's going to get involved.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You have to review it completely because really...

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm going to free you a part

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
why, because I have really done a wonderful job.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But please review the complete form.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
At least the data that should be there.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's it.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I check it and there is no problem if you check it well,

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If not, no problem.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But at least the one that is there, I need it to be reliable.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I need it to charge well.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If I save here, this value, this value, this value here

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is what has to be marked.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's the same as this.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's not allowing me to edit.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I assume something...

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I validate that.

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't worry about that.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But please validate me with the complete form.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And not in pieces.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let me know anything.
